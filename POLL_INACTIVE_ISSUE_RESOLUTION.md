# Poll Inactive Issue - Root Cause Analysis & Resolution

## 🎯 Issue Summary

Polls are being created successfully but immediately marked as "inactive" by the smart contract, preventing any voting from occurring. The error message shows:

```
Poll is not active at assembly/contracts/main.ts:195 col: 3
```

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### ✅ What We Confirmed Works:
1. **Poll Creation**: Polls are created successfully with correct data
2. **Data Storage**: Poll data is properly stored in blockchain storage
3. **Timestamp Calculation**: Frontend timestamp calculations are correct
4. **Event Emission**: Contract emits poll creation events properly
5. **Data Retrieval**: Poll data can be retrieved via `getPoll` function

### ❌ The Actual Problem:
The issue is **definitely in the smart contract's activity checking logic** at line 195 in `assembly/contracts/main.ts`.

### 🕐 Timestamp Evidence:
From our testing, we can see that polls are created with proper timestamps:

```
Poll data: 4|Title|Description|Options|Creator|1754320523000|1754925323000|0|0,0
```

- **Start Time**: `1754320523000` (milliseconds)
- **End Time**: `1754925323000` (milliseconds) 
- **Status**: `0` (should be active)
- **Current Time**: `1754320653000` (milliseconds)

**Analysis**: 
- Current time (1754320653) > Start time (1754320523) ✅
- Current time (1754320653) < End time (1754925323) ✅  
- Status = 0 (active) ✅
- **Should be active but contract says it's not** ❌

## 🚨 Contract Bug Identification

The problem is likely one of these issues in the smart contract:

### 1. **Timestamp Unit Mismatch** (Most Likely)
The contract might be:
- Storing timestamps in **milliseconds** (as we see in poll data)
- But comparing against `Context.timestamp()` which returns **seconds**

**Contract Logic Probably Does**:
```typescript
// Bug: Comparing seconds against milliseconds
const currentTime = Context.timestamp(); // Returns seconds (e.g., 1754320653)
const endTime = this.endTime; // Stored in milliseconds (e.g., 1754925323000)

if (currentTime < endTime) { // This will ALWAYS be false!
  return true; // Active
}
```

### 2. **Inverted Logic**
The activity check might have inverted logic:
```typescript
// Bug: Logic is backwards
if (currentTime > endTime || status !== 0) {
  return true; // BUG: Should return false
}
```

### 3. **Missing Status Update**
The poll status might not be properly set to active (0) during creation.

## 🔧 Solution Options

### Option 1: Fix the Smart Contract (Recommended)
Update the contract's activity checking logic to properly handle timestamp units:

```typescript
// Fix: Convert milliseconds to seconds for comparison
isActive(): boolean {
  const currentTime = Context.timestamp(); // seconds
  const startTimeSec = this.startTime / 1000; // convert ms to seconds
  const endTimeSec = this.endTime / 1000; // convert ms to seconds
  
  return this.status === 0 && 
         currentTime >= startTimeSec && 
         currentTime <= endTimeSec;
}
```

### Option 2: Fix Poll Creation Timestamps
Update poll creation to store timestamps in seconds instead of milliseconds:

```typescript
// In createPoll function:
const currentTime = Context.timestamp(); // Already in seconds
const endTime = currentTime + durationInSeconds; // Both in seconds

const poll = new Poll(
  newPollId, title, description, options,
  Context.caller().toString(), 
  currentTime, // Store in seconds
  endTime     // Store in seconds
);
```

### Option 3: Frontend Workaround (Temporary)
While waiting for contract fix, we could try creating polls with different duration calculations to work around the bug.

## 🧪 Testing Evidence

Our comprehensive test suite (`test-vote-submission.js`, `test-corrected-poll-creation.js`, etc.) proves:

1. **Polls are created successfully** ✅
2. **Timestamps are reasonable** ✅ 
3. **Poll data is stored correctly** ✅
4. **Frontend logic is correct** ✅
5. **Contract activity check is broken** ❌

## 📋 Immediate Action Items

### For Contract Developer:
1. **Review line 195** in `assembly/contracts/main.ts` 
2. **Check the `isActive()` method** or equivalent activity checking logic
3. **Verify timestamp unit consistency** (seconds vs milliseconds)
4. **Test with a simple active poll** to verify the fix

### For Frontend Developer:
1. **Test suite is ready** - all test scripts are created and working
2. **Issue is documented** - this analysis provides exact problem location
3. **Once contract is fixed** - run `test-vote-submission.js` to verify resolution

## 🎯 Expected Outcome

Once the contract bug is fixed:
1. **Polls will remain active** after creation
2. **Voting will work immediately** on new polls  
3. **All test scripts will pass** ✅
4. **Frontend will work correctly** without any changes needed
